            <p>My love of makeup started young while often sneaking 
               into my motherâ€™s makeup vanity and playing with various 
               shades of lipstick, eyeshadow and blush. Makeup became a 
               full blown obsession after four years of art school where
               I learned to master the airbrush technique.
